## Problem Statement

In Singapore, a highly urbanized and densely populated city-state, residents face numerous challenges related to staying informed, engaged, and safe in their neighborhoods. Critical information such as air quality updates, dengue outbreak alerts, construction notices, and local events is often scattered across various platforms, making it difficult for citizens to access timely and relevant information. Additionally, the lack of an efficient feedback mechanism limits residents' ability to actively contribute to shaping their urban environment.

Furthermore, the existing methods of disseminating notices and events suffer from inefficiencies and limitations. For instance, the digital boards installed inside lifts, although present, are hindered by the need to rotate through various advertisements in different languages, reducing their effectiveness. Moreover, these boards are not universally deployed, leading to unequal access to crucial information across neighborhoods. Similarly, notices for essential services such as mosquito pest spray are distributed through printed paper, which often goes unnoticed or is forgotten, diminishing the overall effectiveness of such communication methods.

This fragmented approach to information and engagement hinders the quality of life and well-being of Singaporeans. To address these issues, there is a pressing need for a centralized and user-friendly platform that seamlessly delivers real-time advisories, fosters active participation through polls and feedback, and creates a strong sense of community. By bridging the gap between residents and authorities, this solution can empower individuals to make informed decisions, promote civic engagement, and collectively contribute to a safer, healthier, and more connected Singapore.

## Solution

The proposed solution is an app that allows users to login with SingPass (via Login and MyInfo API) and access relevant and timely information such as AQI, dengue, constructions, maintenance, events near them, etc. The app also enables the authorities to interact with the residents' through polls.

### Remarks

Unfortunately, I faced unexpected personal circumstances that prevented me from completing the assignment as intended. However, I'm genuinely enthusiastic about the National Digital Identity topic, and I believe that the proposal section I submitted reflects my dedication and interest. I hope my efforts in that aspect make up for the incomplete assignment. Thank you for your time and kind understanding.
